# IAMCreds
GUI app to manage AWS IAM credentials

---

This app implements a GUI for users to manage their own AWS IAM
credentials, including Access Keys and Passwords.  The user needs
to have permission to perform these changes themselves.

The app is written using .NET WinForms but has been written and
tested to make sure that it is compatible with the Mono .NET
runtime and it's support for the WinForms framework so it should
be compatible with MacOS and Linux environments.
